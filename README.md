MooTools Crossfade
===========

A lightweight plugin for MooTools that makes it easy to crossfade between a list of images

How to use
----------

We expect this section for every plugin. It just explains how to use your plugin.
Never should a plugin rely on a 3rd party link to explain its behavior or functionality. We need this to ensure that if a website is removed or becomes inaccessible, people can still enjoy your plugins' functionality.

It often includes code snippets, which are just indented pieces of text:

	var script = new MyScript()
	script.doSomething();

Syntax highlighting will be done automatically for you.

Screenshots
-----------

This section is optional, but encouraged if the plugin affords it. Just a list of images, one per line. We do the resizing, so use actual size screenshots.

Arbitrary section
-----------------

This is an arbitrary section. You can have as many of these as you want.
Some arbitrary section examples:

* FAQ
* Notes
* Misc
* Known issues

The name is up to you, but remember to keep it meaningful and simple. Arbitrary sections are always optional.
